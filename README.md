## Tool Used 
  Machine Learning , Computer Vision , Python
## Libraries Used 
  Numpy, Pandas, Mediapipe, Open-cv
## Abstract
  This project promotes an approach for Human Computer Interaction where volume function can be controlled using  a real time webcam or device camera.It's an alternative   to curent methods including manual input through keyboard or controlling mouse physically.These type of projects uses device camera and computer vision techniques to     control various tasks that are controlled physically.  
## Problem Statement 
  In Today's world human life getting Technologically advance with the help of artificial intelligence. This project will help in making human life easier 
  and will act as a Time saver application by acting as a motion detecting application.
  The main aim of this project is to design and develop a volume gesture application which can increase or decrease the volume of your device through hand or fingers       gestures.
  The motivation is to create an object tracking application to interact with the computer, and develop a virtual human-computer interaction device.
